This is a git card, which uses GitHub API and shows the chosen user's followers, repositories and stars.Since that API does not include information about users' stars I used for that starred-count library.

To run this app you need to do
1. git clone https://github.com/ArmLil/git-card-react.git
2. cd git-card-react
3. npm install
4. npm run start
